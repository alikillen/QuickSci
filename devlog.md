- just messing around with creating site
- looked at old weebly site - its awful, i can make something better
- just would need to embed animate PDFs better and optimise for mobile
- sent request for PDFs, image logo to natalie, outlined SVG needs
- looked at websites for - cosmos, national geographic, frankie mag, pepoermint mag, science
- interesting that more traditional science magazines websites were immediately not as appealing - not as well designed, colours etc, and socials were not as prominent
- started from scratch but could look at HTML templates
- realised i proabbly need to mockup some wireframes but I still kinda hate wireframes
